The Debug Toolbar
=================

The 3rd party ``django-debug-toolbar`` is a package that everyone should be using in development. Once installed, it shows up as a sidebar on your website, and it reports all kinds of things, e.g., how long queries take.

It only runs in development (that is to say, when the ``DEBUG`` setting is set to ``True``).
