Development Tools
=================

The following tools are essential.

* **python 3.4+** (https://www.python.org/downloads) - Use version 3.4 or higher.
* **pip** (https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) - A command line tool that lets you install and manage Python packages.
* **pyenv** (https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer) - A command line tool that lets you install any number of Python versions on your system, and then switch between them easily. It even lets you set which version a particular project should use.
* **pyvenv** - A command line tool that lets you sandbox your Python projects (i.e., create virtual environments). An older variant called **virtualenv** was popular for years, but this one ships standard with Python 3.4+. Note that it is spelled similarly to **pyenv**, but this one has a ``v`` in the middle.
* **git** (https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Use git for version control.
